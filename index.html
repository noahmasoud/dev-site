        <p>
          i'm a driven, detail-oriented, problem-solving individual with love for swe/math.
          currently i'm a first-generation student in my junior year, pursuing a degree in computer science
          and applied mathematics, at texas state university.
        </p>
        <p>
          initially, i enrolled at texas tech unicersity studying finance, with a plan to work my way into
          investment banking. although i quickly found my love for technical thinking and wanted
          to be someone who embarks on the future of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          my current interests are full stack evelopment, machine learning, and entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
          while i am not in the hitting the books, you'll can find me listening to music,
          spending time outdoors, playing chess, hanging at a food-truck in austin or floating the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          take a tour of my website and see some of my work. my plan is to get all of my projects
          on this site with demos for everyone to see, and visualize some of the things i work on.
